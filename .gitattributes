# Explicitly recognize .sql files as SQL
*.sql linguist-language=SQL

# Treat dbt .sql files as a blend of SQL and Jinja (Linguist handles this default well)
# If needed, you could force recognition as 'SQL'
# models/*.sql linguist-language=SQL 

# Ensure .yml files are counted as YAML
*.yml linguist-language=YAML

# If you have Python code and it's being missed:
